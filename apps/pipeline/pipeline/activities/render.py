The whole design here turns on one fact: because our MoneyPrinterTurbo fork
accepts a caller-supplied task id, we set `task_id = production_id`. That makes
the render's identity *derivable* rather than something we must successfully
persist, which removes the worst failure window in the pipeline -- MPT
returning 200 while we time out before recording the id it gave us.
