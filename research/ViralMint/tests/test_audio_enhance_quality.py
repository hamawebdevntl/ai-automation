"""Enhancing audio must improve it, and enhancing it twice must not ruin it.

Reported as "the chained output sounds rough". Measurement told the story: the
source was ALREADY normalized (the clip pipeline had enhanced it once), and
every further pass re-compressed what dynamics remained while the level stayed
put — LRA 1.4 → 1.0 → 0.8 across two runs, plus a lossy generation each time.

Two root causes:

1. Single-pass loudnorm runs in DYNAMIC mode. That is not a less accurate
   version of normalization — it is a different algorithm that continuously
   rides the gain (audible pumping) and crushes loudness range. Enhance is now
   two-pass: measure, then apply ONE fixed gain with linear=true.

   ffmpeg SILENTLY reverts linear=true to dynamic in two cases
   (af_loudnorm.c), and both are pre-empted in `_linear_filter`. Both traps
   are pinned below, deterministically, off the filter string.

2. Enhancing already-normalized audio is a harmful no-op. The runner measures
   first and passes the file through untouched with an explanatory warning.

These tests shell out to a real ffmpeg — they're skipped where it's absent.
