"""Staleness-aware zombie-job sweep + restart-handoff watcher.

The boot sweep used to fail EVERY running/pending job, on the assumption that a
restart implies the previous process is gone. That is false: uvicorn frees its
listening socket at the START of graceful shutdown, so during a launcher
port-takeover a NEW backend boots while the OLD one is still draining
background jobs. The sweep would stamp a still-completing generation "Server
restarted — job did not complete"; the job then finished and last-write-won, so
the user saw a failure toast for a video that actually landed in the Library.
The sharp edge is a trusting retry redoing all the work.

Now every accepted update_job_status call touches Job.updated_at (progress
ticks route through it via ws_manager.send_progress), the boot sweep fails only
STALE jobs, and a lifespan watcher re-checks the fresh survivors until they
finish or go stale. These tests pin each piece.

Ported from the SaaS variant. DB-backed: rows use unique per-test user ids and
are deleted in a finally block.
