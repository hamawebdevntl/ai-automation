"""The JS runtime handed to yt-dlp must reflect the machine, not a guess.

`js_runtimes` was hardcoded to `{"node": {}}`. Explicitly passing the option
REPLACES yt-dlp's default, so this carried two silent failures on a machine
without Node — which is the common case for a packaged desktop install, since
the app bundles no JS runtime:

  * a user with deno but not node got NO runtime, because the pin disabled the
    deno default;
  * with no runtime the EJS solver can't run, n-signature challenges go
    unsolved, and YouTube formats go missing or answer 403 — in a bug report
    that is indistinguishable from a cookie problem.

Also covered: the 403 cookie-drop rung. Supplying ANY cookie makes yt-dlp skip
every player client that can't carry one (android_vr / tv_simply / ios — the
token-free ones), so a 403 is often caused BY the jar and retrying with it can
only fail the same way.
