"""Per-download yt-dlp options — the single source of truth.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
Downloading is the most load-bearing feature in the app, and it is reached
from several places: the Video Download tool page, the chat planner's
`download_url` action, channel batch downloads, and the internal scout path.
Letting each one build its own yt-dlp option dict is how the download ladder
gets bypassed and how the surfaces drift apart on what "1080p" means. So the
vocabulary, the validation and the translation to yt-dlp live here once, and
every caller takes the same road.

THE SAFETY PROPERTY THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING BELOW
`normalize(None)` and `normalize({})` return {}, and `format_chain(None)`
returns None, which callers MUST treat as "use the existing
FORMAT_FALLBACK_CHAIN unchanged". A caller that passes no options gets a
byte-identical download to what shipped before this module existed. Options
are strictly opt-in; nothing here can regress the default path.

The second property: a quality request must never turn a download that would
have worked into a failure. Every capped ladder therefore ENDS in the same
unconstrained rungs the default chain uses. If a source has nothing at or
below the requested cap, the user gets a larger file rather than an error —
and `download_video` reports the height it actually delivered so the UI can
say so instead of quietly implying the cap was honoured.

NOT HANDLED HERE, ON PURPOSE
There is no "audio only" or "subtitles only" quality. `download_video`
already extracts a companion .mp3 next to every video for the transcript
pipeline, and the Export Subtitles tool already turns a video into an
.srt/.vtt. This module covers options that modify the VIDEO download —
including embedding subtitles/thumbnail/metadata INTO the container, which no
existing path does.

# Requested max height → the ladder of yt-dlp format selectors to try.

# Each ladder is capped rungs first, then the unconstrained tail so a cap can
# never cause an outright failure (see module docstring). "best" has no capped
# rung at all — it IS the uncapped tail.
#
# Note these deliberately do NOT restate `format_sort`: that lives in
# `_yt_dlp_base_opts()` and applies uniformly. Format SELECTORS gate
# eligibility; format SORT picks the best of what's eligible. Both are needed.
